**Recall the task**
<br />
<br />
We need to construct 2 models for prediction number of departed (which is a A25 column of our data set).<br />
One of them should be **logit model** and the other one **tobit model**
<br />
<br />
So let's start with importing necessary data.
```{r}
library(haven)
df <- read_sav("D:/MyProjects/Econometrics_Homeworks/Final_Project-Case_Study/DI2007_Regional_Database.sav")
```
